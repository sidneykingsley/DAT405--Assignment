DAT405

My program is built out of three layers. The first is the setting sun graphic, then there is the third layer and its background. These are built on top of each other, however I have only used the background layer once so that I could achieve the effect with both shapes shown at once in the final part. I have created conditional statements that interact with the sketches for you to create a sequence with the effect similar to what I had in mind. However, it is possible to interact and adjust the controls yourself as the user. The main control is the y coordinate of your mouse, by moving this you adjust the frame rate, speeding up or slowing down the sketch. If you hit "enter" the sketches will alternate and "space bar" activates the Perlin noise function which applies randomness to the size of the rectangles. All of these instructions are available inside the webpage in a dropdown in the top left corner. 
For the first time watching this piece I suggest putting the mouse pointer as low down on the screen as possible and letting it run.
